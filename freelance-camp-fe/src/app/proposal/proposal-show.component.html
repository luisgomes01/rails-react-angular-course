        <p>Hi <span class="text-primary">{{ proposal.customer }}</span>,</p>

        <p>
          It was a pleasure getting to meet with you and review your project
          requirements, I believe it is a great fit for the types of
          applications that I build out. Please feel free to check out some of
          my past projects
          <a href="{{ proposal.portfolio_url }}">here</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
          To successfully build out the application I will be utilizing
          <span class="text-primary">{{ proposal.tools }}</span>, and a number of other tools to ensure that the
          project follows industry wide best practices.
        </p>

        <p>
          Ensuring that you are fully informed is one of my top priorities, so
          in addition to incorporating everything that we discussed, I will also
          be creating a project management dashboard and sending you a project
          update message daily so that you can have a transparent view of the
          development as it takes place.
        </p>

        <p>
          To accomplish the project and meet the requirements that we discussed,
          I am estimating that it will take <span class="text-primary">{{ proposal.estimated_hours }}</span> hours
          in development time to complete. The project should take
          <span class="text-primary">{{ proposal.weeks_to_complete }}</span> weeks to complete and with my hourly
          rate of <span class="text-primary">{{ proposal.hourly_rate }}</span>/hour, the estimated total will be
          <span class="text-primary">{{
            proposal.hourly_rate * proposal.estimated_hours
              | currency: "USD":true:".0"
          }}</span>.
        </p>

        <p>
          The next step from here is to set up a meeting to finalize the project
          and sign contracts.
        </p>

        <p>I am excited to working with you and build out this project.</p>
